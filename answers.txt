What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
Merging and rebasing are both ways to combine/integrate changes from one branch to another. 
Git merge specifically ties the histories of the main and feature branch together. It differs 
from rebasing in that the feature branch will have to make a merge commit every time changes 
need to be incorporated from the main branch. On the other hand rebasing re-writes the project 
history by moving the entire feature branch to begin at the tip of the main branch, essentially 
combining all the new commits in main. It also differs in that you get a much cleaner project 
history but at the same time loses the context provided by merging.

What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is digital space that allows users to store, manage, and share project code. 
It is commonly used for project development and serves as a shared location where various developers
can collaborate on a project by combining their work. It can store different versions of project code
and is hosted on a remote server or platform.
